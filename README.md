# Simple AWS + Terraform Frontend App

## Purpose

This project was created to play around with AWS services and with Terraform, not to forget how to use it :)

Why frontend? Because I wanted to try it as well!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## CI/CD not working

The repo is a fork of a private one, in which deploy works just fine. This one does not contain any secrets and tfstate files, so it won't work.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
